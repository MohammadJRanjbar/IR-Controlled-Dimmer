# IR-Controlled-Light-Dimmer
# Introduction
Dimmer in English: Dimmer is used to adjust the amount of voltage or brightness and in the automotive industry is called the switch to change the strong light (high light) and low light (low light).
Upon receiving the voltage, this device provides voltage from near zero to near the source voltage as output. Dimmers have different types and designs depending on the type of application.
Dimmers are available in AC and DC types, the dimmer uses an electronic component called a triac.
This device is used to increase or decrease the light of house lamps and areas where the light used varies. A dimmer is a variable resistor or potentiometer. It is installed in the circuit of the phase wire path (such as installing a single bridge switch). The dimmer structure has two contacts, one of which is the phase input point and the other is the phase output point. Since the dimmer controls the voltage, it is one of the methods of controlling the speed of electric motors, so the dimmer can be used as a speed controller for single-phase electric motors with low power, such as ceiling fan motors.
# Types of dimmers
* Resistance ( manual )
In this type of dimmer, the work of controlling and adjusting the fire angle of the triac is done by a resistor and a potentiometer. By turning the dimmer volume, the light of the lamp increases and decreases.
* Digital
In digital dimmer, the triac fire angle is controlled digitally by the processor and the keys Pressure or remote control is performed.

#Triac
Triac is a high-speed solid-state component that has the ability to switch and control the AC power of a sine waveform. The Triac acts exactly like two ordinary thyristors connected in parallel (back to back), and because of this structure, the two thyristors will have a common gate base. The input signal phase control controls the power average it delivers, although the triac is excited and turned on in both the positive and negative half-cycles of the

# Digital dimmer control
•	There are a variety of control methods available today, including:
•	Control via button or key
•	•Touch control system
•	Remote control
o	Remote control (Wi-Fi or red Mauden)
o	Audio control system, response to specific audio signals
